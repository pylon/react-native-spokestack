## Gotchas

### Android

- Requires Android SDK 24 level support
- Requires Gradle 3.0.1+ (`classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.0.1'` in root `build.gradle` `dependencies`)
- Add app setting for microphone permission

The example usage uses the system-provided ASRs (`AndroidSpeechRecognizer` and `AppleSpeechRecognizer`). `AndroidSpeechRecognizer` is not available on 100% of devices, though; see our [ASR documentation](https://spokestack.io/docs/Concepts/asr) for more information. If you use a different ASR provider, you'll also need to change the `input` line to:

`input: "io.spokestack.spokestack.android.MicrophoneInput",`


### iOS

- Add app setting for microphone permission (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`) and speech recognition (`NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`)
- Spokestack on iOS does not manage `AudioSession` settings. The client app is required to implement whatever `AudioSession` category and options are necessary. At minimum, the session category should allow for recording, eg `AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord` or `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord`. A simple `AudioSession` setting, suitable for insertion in `AppDelegate.m`, could be:
```
  [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord mode:AVAudioSessionModeDefault options:AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker  error:nil];
  [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:YES error:nil];
```

## Release
  1. Ensure that CocoaPods has been installed via `gem`, not via `brew`
  2. Increment `version` in `package.json`
  3. `git commit -a -m 'YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE' && git tag YOUR_VERSION && git push --origin`
  4. `pod spec lint --use-libraries --allow-warnings --use-modular-headers`,  which should pass all but one checks (expect `ERROR | [iOS] xcodebuild: Returned an unsuccessful exit code. You can use `--verbose` for more information.`)
  5. edit `/Library/Ruby/Gems/YOUR_RUBY_VERSION/gems/cocoapods-trunk-YOUR_COCOAPODS_VERSION/lib/pod/command/trunk/push.rb`, comment out `validate_podspec_files` (https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/lib/cocoapods/command/repo/push.rb#L77)*
  6. `pod trunk register YOUR_EMAIL --description='release YOUR_PODSPEC_VERSION'`
  7. `npm publish` to release on NPM
  8. `pod trunk push --use-libraries --allow-warnings --use-modular-headers`

* Since `RNSpokestack` iOS requires React Native headers, but does not include any React Native dependencies, it will not compile by itself, needing a client library that does include the React Native dependency.
